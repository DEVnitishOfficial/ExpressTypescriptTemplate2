# Setting up a Typescript Template Project

## Context before Starting a Typescript Template Project

* Typescript is based upon the javascript and javascript is versatile language which empowers a lot of different-different project and applications.

* Like web-client, mobile-client, servers (using nodejs), desktop applications (Electron framework), mobile apps (react-native) **But**,

* javascript is a loosely typed language, which gives us ease of programming. With ease of programming it gives some headache as well if we are developing a large application.

* Whenever we are writing code in pure js then we have to be vigilant enough so that we can be aware about what type of data is stored in a particular variable, because in js everything is decided on the runtime. To solve this problem strictly typed languages come into picture like C, C++, Java, Typescript.

* These strictly typed languages can identify error for us on runtime itself. Suppose if a variable is intended to store number and if we are storing string then on runtime it will give us compilation error.

* If we can write code in typescript then for us it will be very easy to move to Java, Go, and other strictly typed languages.

* Typescript is a strongly typed language and it's a superset of js, i.e. it has all the features of js and extra is type. Every variable and function have their type attached. With type our code becomes predictable.

* In large code bases when developers are contributing then if they don't have used type then it will become very cumbersome to find out the error. Suppose if a variable is storing number but you provide it string and because we don't have any type checking we also miss it. So later it becomes an error, when other developers are expecting the number but they got the string.

---

# Setting up Project

* Since Node.js is a JavaScript runtime environment and we want to use Typescript in our project, so in order to execute the Typescript we need `ts-node` which will internally convert the Typescript code to JavaScript on the fly, because at the end js code is executed with all type definitions.

> *Just-in-time (JIT) compilation is a method where code is translated into machine code during the execution of a program, rather than before.*----> this happens only when once our code is converted into bytecode.
---

## 1. Creating `package.json`

```bash
npm init -y       # starts a fresh package.json file
npm i express     # install express
```

## i. Dev Dependencies:

Dev dependencies (short for development dependencies) are packages that are only needed during the development and testing phases of a project, but not when the application is running in production. In production we need the js files or bundles, not the Typescript.

* ts-node is a TypeScript execution engine and REPL for Node.js.
* it convert ts code to js on the fly.

```bash
npm install -D ts-node              # installing ts-node as dev dependency
npm install -D @types/express       # provide type definition of express framework
```

* Since express is a JavaScript framework and written in JS, the types enable TypeScript to understand the structure of those libraries ‚Äî including functions, objects, classes, etc. ‚Äî and offer type checking, autocomplete, and intellisense.

  * Example: `req: Request`, `res: Response`, `next: NextFunction`, etc.

```bash
npm install -D @types/node          # This provides type definitions for Node.js built-in modules like Buffer, Process, setTimeout, clearInterval.
```

* NodeJS namespace for internal types

```bash
npm install -D nodemon              # Automatically re-start the server when file changes in the directory are detected
```

* Node.js natively supports also `node --watch index.js`

---

## Configuring Typescript

The meaning of configuring the Typescript is that how Typescript should behave and what settings we want to enable. Like if any type issue comes do you want to show them or not while compiling the ts code to js. So whenever Typescript compiler runs it will run using that config file.

```bash
npm install typescript              # Typescript available as a package so we can install it easily
npx tsc --init                      # it will create a tsconfig.json file with all the configuration, which we can modify according to our need or specific requirement
```

* `tsconfig` file will tell the Typescript compiler what options they have to use while compiling the Typescript code to JS.

---

## Edit `tsconfig.json` File

In the `tsconfig` file we have added two extra properties which tell Typescript compiler which files you have to compile or which ones should be excluded.

```json
"include": [
  "./src/**/*" // it says whatever files are present in src compile all those files
],
"exclude": [
  "node_modules" // tsc says don't compile the node_modules because it's an external module and doesn't lie in our business logic
],
"outDir": "./dist" // The outDir option specifies the directory where the compiled JavaScript files (and related .js.map and .d.ts files) will be placed
```

* `npx`: If a package is configured to run directly in terminal then using `npx` we can run that package in terminal.

---

# Setting up Server

Created a file `Server.ts` in `src` folder.

* How to run it:

```bash
cd src
npx ts-node server.ts
```

* When you run this command, the Typescript on the fly converts this Typescript code to JS and executes, and we don't have to manually convert this Typescript code to JavaScript.

* If you run:

```bash
npx tsc
```

* Then it will create a compiled JS file in the `dist` folder, with type checking. And again if you run:

```bash
node dist/Server.js
```

* Then similar to previous one it will start server on port 3000.

---

# ‚öôÔ∏è Writing the Config Layer

## üì¶ Storing Sensitive Configuration with Environment Variables

When building a **scalable backend project**, especially one meant for **production**, we often deal with sensitive and environment-specific configuration information. This includes:

* Server ports
* Database URLs and credentials
* API keys and secrets
* Redis configurations
* Email credentials

Revealing such information publicly can lead to serious **security vulnerabilities**.

To address this, we use **environment variables**, often defined in a `.env` file that is **not committed to version control**.

---

## üåç What is an Environment Variable?

Environment variables are **key-value pairs** stored at the **operating system (OS)** level. They are accessible by any process or application running on your machine.

### ‚úÖ Key Characteristics:

* Accessible by all processes during runtime.
* Used to configure application behavior **without changing code**.
* Commonly used to store **secure and configurable data**.
* Can be system-wide or user-specific.

---

## üìå Viewing Environment Variables

### On Windows (CMD):

```cmd
set
```

### On macOS/Linux:

```bash
env
```

These commands will list all available environment variables in your current shell session.

---

## ‚úçÔ∏è Setting Environment Variables

### On macOS/Linux (temporary):

```bash
export SERVER_NAME="DEV_SERVER"
```

### On Windows CMD (temporary):

```cmd
set SERVER_NAME=DEV_SERVER
```

### üî¥ Problem:

Temporary variables **only persist in the current terminal session**. They are not shared between different terminal tabs or after reboot.

---

## ‚úÖ Persistent Environment Variables

### üîß macOS/Linux:

Add the export line to your shell profile file:

* `.bashrc`, `.zshrc`, `.bash_profile`, etc.

Example:

```bash
export SERVER_NAME="DEV_SERVER"
```

### ü™ü Windows:

Use `setx` for permanent environment variables:

```cmd
setx SERVER_NAME "DEV_SERVER"
```

> Note: You need to **restart CMD** to see the updated variable.

Alternatively, use the **System Properties GUI**:

1. Search: *"Edit the system environment variables"*
2. Go to **Environment Variables**
3. Add new **User** or **System** variable

---

## üö´ Why Not Use System-Level Env Vars in Production?

Managing environment variables manually across multiple servers or containers in microservices architecture is:

* ‚ùå Error-prone
* ‚ùå Time-consuming
* ‚ùå Not scalable

---

## ‚úÖ Solution: Use `dotenv` in Node.js

The [`dotenv`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv) package allows you to load environment variables from a `.env` file into `process.env`.

### üõ† Steps to Use:

1. **Install dotenv**:

```bash
npm install dotenv
```

2. **Create `.env` file in the project root**:

```env
PORT=3002
REDIS_HOST=localhost
REDIS_PORT=6379
MAIL_USER=myemail@example.com
MAIL_PASS=securepassword
```

3. **Create `config/index.ts` file**:

```ts
import dotenv from "dotenv";

dotenv.config();

export const serverConfig = {
    PORT: Number(process.env.PORT) || 3002,
    REDIS_HOST: process.env.REDIS_HOST || 'localhost',
    REDIS_PORT: Number(process.env.REDIS_PORT) || 6379,
    MAIL_USER: process.env.MAIL_USER || '',
    MAIL_PASS: process.env.MAIL_PASS || ''
};
```

4. **Use in your code**:

```ts
import { serverConfig } from "./config";

const redisConfig = {
    host: serverConfig.REDIS_HOST,
    port: serverConfig.REDIS_PORT,
    maxRetriesPerRequest: null, 
};
```

‚úÖ Now you can access environment variables in a **structured and readable** way using `serverConfig`.

---

## üîê Extra Security with Azure Key Vault (Optional)

For production-grade applications, you can use **Azure Key Vault** or similar secret management tools (e.g., AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault).

### üîë What is Azure Key Vault?

Azure Key Vault is a **cloud service** for securely storing and accessing:

* API keys
* Passwords
* Certificates
* Cryptographic keys

It offers:

* Centralized secret management
* Role-based access control
* Improved compliance and auditability

# üß† Separation of Concerns in Express.js

Modern server-side applications benefit greatly from clean code organization. One of the key principles to achieve this is **Separation of Concerns (SoC)**‚Äîwhere each part of your application has a clear, dedicated responsibility.

---

## üìÅ 1. Separating Controller Logic from `server.ts`

### ‚ùå Problem: Controller code inside `server.ts`

```ts
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
    res.send("Hi, I am the home page");
});
```

* This inline handler directly inside the server setup violates SOC(seperation of concern).
* It mixes routing,controller, business logic, and response handling all in one place.

---

### ‚úÖ Solution: Move logic to a controller

Create a dedicated file: `controllers/ping.controller.ts`

```ts
import { Request, Response } from "express";

export const pingHandler = (req: Request, res: Response) => {
    res.send("Hi, I am the home page");
};
```

> **Why define types explicitly?**
> Since this is now a **standalone function**, TypeScript cannot infer `req` and `res` types like it does inside `app.get(...)`. Hence, we import and declare their types explicitly from `express`.

---

## üìÅ 2. Separating Router Logic from `server.ts`

### ‚ùå Problem: Routing handled directly inside `server.ts`

```ts
import { pingHandler } from './controllers/ping.controller';
app.get('/', pingHandler);
```

This ties the routing logic directly to the main application file.

---

### ‚úÖ Solution 1: Basic Router Factory (Not Recommended for Scale)

```ts
// server.ts
import { createPingRouter } from './routers/ping.router';
createPingRouter(app);
```

```ts
// routers/ping.router.ts
import { Express } from "express";
import { pingHandler } from "../controllers/ping.controller";

export function createPingRouter(app: Express) {
    app.get('/', pingHandler);
}
```

While this works, it has serious **drawbacks**:

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Problems with This Approach

#### 1. **Global Side Effects**

* **Definition:** Function modifies the global `app` object.
* **Example:**

  ```ts
  createPingRouter(app);  // adds GET '/'
  createAnotherRouter(app);  // also adds GET '/'
  ```
* **Issue:** Any router can unintentionally override or duplicate routes.

---

#### 2. **Route Conflicts**

* **Definition:** Multiple routers may register the same path (`'/'`), leading to unpredictable behavior.
* **Example:**

  ```ts
  app.get('/', handlerA);  // from ping.router
  app.get('/', handlerB);  // from home.router
  ```
* **Issue:** Only the last route wins; earlier ones are ignored.

---

#### 3. **Tight Coupling**

* **Definition:** Route logic is tightly bound to the `app` instance.
* **Issue:** Hard to test routes in isolation.

  ```ts
  // Can't do this:
  test(pingRouter); // ‚ùå Not possible
  ```

---

#### 4. **Scalability Issues**

* **Definition:** As the app grows, registering all routes directly on `app` leads to poor maintainability.
* **Example:**

  ```ts
  // 20+ routers modifying app directly
  // Hard to track or debug
  ```

---

## üìÅ 3. ‚úÖ Recommended: Using `express.Router()` for Clean Routing

### ‚ú® Modular Router Setup

```ts
// server.ts
import pingRouter from './routers/ping.router';
app.use('/ping', pingRouter);  // Mounts pingRouter at '/ping'
```

```ts
// routers/ping.router.ts
import express from 'express';
import { pingHandler } from '../controllers/ping.controller';

const pingRouter = express.Router();
pingRouter.get('/', pingHandler);  // Handles GET '/ping'

export default pingRouter;
```

---

### ‚úÖ Advantages of This Approach

#### 1. **Modularity**

* Routers are self-contained units.
* Easy to understand, maintain, and scale.
* üìÅ Example: `pingRouter` handles only `/ping`-related logic.

---

#### 2. **Avoids Global Side Effects**

* Routes don‚Äôt modify the `app` directly.
* Promotes safer, predictable behavior in teams or large codebases.

---

#### 3. **Better Route Organization**

* Group routes by domain (e.g., `authRouter`, `todoRouter`, etc.).
* Example:

  ```ts
  app.use('/user', userRouter);
  app.use('/auth', authRouter);
  app.use('/ping', pingRouter);
  ```

---

#### 4. **Scalable and Testable**

* Routers can be tested independently without booting the entire app.

  ```ts
  test(pingRouter); // ‚úÖ Possible now
  ```

---

## ‚úÖ Summary: Best Practices

| Concern            | Poor Practice                        | Best Practice                      |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------- |
| Controller Logic   | Inline in `server.ts`                | Move to `controllers/`             |
| Routing Logic      | Direct `app.get(...)` in `server.ts` | Use `express.Router()`             |

# üß© Setting Up Middleware in Express (with TypeScript)

### üìñ Reference:

Read more from the official Express documentation:
üëâ [Using Middleware ‚Äì Express Docs](https://expressjs.com/en/guide/using-middleware.html)

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è What is Middleware?

**Express** is a routing and middleware-based web framework. It provides minimal functionality out of the box ‚Äî the power comes from chaining multiple **middleware functions** together.

A **middleware function** in Express is simply a function that has access to:

* the **request object (`req`)**
* the **response object (`res`)**
* the **next middleware function (`next`)** in the request‚Äìresponse cycle.

### Middleware Functions Can:

* Execute any kind of logic or code.
* Modify the `req` or `res` objects.
* End the request‚Äìresponse cycle (by sending a response).
* Or, pass control to the next middleware using `next()`.

üëâ **Important:**
If the current middleware doesn‚Äôt send a response or end the cycle, it **must call `next()`** ‚Äî otherwise, the request will hang forever.

---

## üß± Types of Middleware in Express

1. **Application-level middleware** ‚Äì bound to an instance of the `app` object.
2. **Router-level middleware** ‚Äì bound to an instance of `express.Router()`.
3. **Error-handling middleware** ‚Äì defined with four parameters `(err, req, res, next)`.
4. **Built-in middleware** ‚Äì provided by Express itself (like `express.json()` or `express.static()`).
5. **Third-party middleware** ‚Äì community packages like `cors`, `helmet`, or `morgan`.

---

## üí° Use Case of Middleware

Middleware is often used for **Separation of Concerns (SoC)** ‚Äî each middleware focuses on a single responsibility.

Example use case flow:

```
request 
   ‚Üì
validateRequestBody
   ‚Üì
validateAuthentication
   ‚Üì
validateAuthorization
   ‚Üì
operationController
```

### Example Scenario:

* üßæ **Validate Request Body:** ensure the incoming data is clean and in the correct format.
* üîê **Authenticate User:** check whether the request contains a valid JWT token.
* üß≠ **Authorize User:** verify whether the authenticated user has permission to access a specific resource.
* ‚öôÔ∏è **Call Controller:** once all checks pass, control moves to the route handler (controller) to perform the actual operation.

---

## üîó How Express Implements Middleware Internally

The middleware system in Express is inspired by the **‚ÄúChain of Responsibility‚Äù** design pattern.

This pattern allows a request to pass through a series of handlers (middleware functions).
Each middleware decides either to:

* Handle the request completely, or
* Pass it along to the next function in the chain by calling `next()`.

This pattern makes Express flexible, modular, and easy to extend ‚Äî because each piece of functionality can be separated into its own middleware layer.

---

## üß∞ The `app.use()` Middleware

`app.use()` is used to **mount middleware** functions at the application level.

It applies to **all routes** that come **after it** in the middleware stack.

### Example:

```ts
import express, { Express } from 'express';
import { genericErrorHandler, attachCorrelationIdMiddleware } from './middlewares';

const app: Express = express();

// Parse JSON body for all incoming requests
app.use(express.json());

// Attach a unique ID to each request for tracing
app.use(attachCorrelationIdMiddleware);

// Handle errors globally
app.use(genericErrorHandler);
```

So whenever any request comes in, it first passes through these global middlewares before reaching any specific route.

---

## üß≠ API Versioning in Express

**API Versioning** allows you to maintain multiple versions of your API (for example `/api/v1` and `/api/v2`) without breaking old clients when introducing new features or changes.

You can implement versioning easily using `app.use()`:

```ts
import express, { Express } from 'express';
import v1Router from './routes/v1';
import v2Router from './routes/v2';

const app: Express = express();

// Versioned routing
app.use('/api/v1', v1Router);
app.use('/api/v2', v2Router);
```

---

### üì¶ Inside the `v1` Router

You can create a router for version 1 using `express.Router()`:

```ts
import express from 'express';
import { pingHandler } from '../../controllers/pingController';

const pingRouter = express.Router();

// Define route
pingRouter.get('/', pingHandler);

export default pingRouter;
```

---

### üß† The Route Handler (Controller)

A simple route handler (controller) might look like this:

```ts
import { Request, Response } from 'express';

export const pingHandler = (req: Request, res: Response) => {
  res.send("Hi, I am the home page!");
};
```

This function gets executed once all preceding middlewares (like authentication, validation, etc.) have successfully passed control using `next()`.

---

## üèÅ Summary

| Concept                 | Purpose                                                        |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Middleware**          | Functions that process requests before reaching the controller |
| **`next()`**            | Passes control to the next middleware in the chain             |
| **`app.use()`**         | Mounts global middleware or routes                             |
| **API Versioning**      | Organizes routes by version (v1, v2, etc.)                     |

## Hot reloading by using the nodemon(like the react ones)
### add script and run from the root directory then it will load the .env variable otherwise you will get undefined wherever you are loading env variable
```js
"start": "ts-node src/server.ts",
"dev": "nodemon src/server.ts",
```

---

# üîÑ Serialization and Deserialization in Express.js

When we build APIs, data can be sent from the **client (frontend or Postman)** to the **server (backend)** in different ways. In Express, we usually handle data in three main forms:

---

## üì¨ 1. Sending Data to the Backend

### i. **Query Parameters and URL Parameters**

Example:

```
http://localhost:3000/users/456/orders/B-99?status=completed&limit=10
```

* **URL Parameters:** `456` and `B-99`
* **Query Parameters:** `status=completed` and `limit=10`

| Parameter Type | Example                          | Description                                   |
| -------------- | -------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| URL Params     | `/users/:userId/orders/:orderId` | Used to identify a specific resource          |
| Query Params   | `?status=completed&limit=10`     | Used for filtering, sorting, pagination, etc. |

---

### ii. **Request Body (req.body)**

The body is commonly used in **POST**, **PUT**, and **PATCH** requests to send structured data such as JSON, form data, etc.

Example:

```json
{
  "items_updated": 2,
  "total_cost": 45.50,
  "shipping_address": {
    "street": "123 Dev Lane",
    "city": "Codeville"
  }
}
```

---

## üí° How to Receive Client Data in Express

Let‚Äôs say we send this request from Postman to:

```
POST http://localhost:3015/api/v1/ping/
```

Body:

```json
{
  "name": "nitish",
  "company": "google"
}
```

Handler:

```ts
import { Request, Response } from "express";

export const pingHandler = (req: Request, res: Response) => {
  console.log('my request body:', req.body);
  res.send("Pong");
};
```

If you see the console output as:

```
my request body: undefined
```

---

## ‚ùì Why is `req.body` Undefined?

By default, Express **does not automatically know how to parse incoming request bodies**.
The body can arrive in different formats ‚Äî JSON, plain text, form-data, XML, etc.
Unlike query params (which are always strings), `req.body` can have **different content types**, so Express doesn‚Äôt assume one by default.

### üß© Why Express Doesn‚Äôt Parse Automatically

Because Express is designed to be:

> ‚Äú**Fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js**‚Äù

Here, **unopinionated** means Express doesn‚Äôt force you to use a specific way of handling data.
You decide how to parse the incoming data using appropriate middleware.

---

## üß† The Solution ‚Äî Tell Express How to Parse Data

You need to **register middleware** that tells Express what type of incoming data to expect and how to parse it.

### For JSON data:

```ts
app.use(express.json());
```

This parses incoming requests with `Content-Type: application/json`.

### For URL-encoded data (like HTML form submissions):

```ts
app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: true }));
```

---

## üîç What Happens Behind the Scenes (Serialization & Deserialization)

When data travels from the client to the server:

1. It‚Äôs converted into **bytes** (serialized) to send over the network.
2. On the server side, those bytes are **converted back into JavaScript objects** (deserialized).

This process of encoding (serialization) and decoding (deserialization) is handled internally by Express (through the middlewares like `express.json()`).

In other languages like **Go**, you often need to perform this process manually.

---

## üßæ How Express Detects Data Format

Express determines how to parse the incoming body based on the **HTTP headers**, specifically the `Content-Type` header.

Example (from Postman):

```
Content-Type: application/json
```

When Express sees this header, it knows to parse the body using the JSON parser.

---

## üî° What is URL Encoding?

The browser‚Äôs address bar doesn‚Äôt support all characters directly (for example: spaces, slashes, or special symbols).
So, when such characters appear in URLs, they are automatically **encoded**.

Example of a URL from Flipkart:

```
https://www.flipkart.com/...&fm=productRecommendation%2FcrossSelling&iid=R%3Ac%3Bp%3AMOB...
```

Here, some characters are URL-encoded:

| Symbol | Encoded |
| ------ | ------- |
| `+`    | `%2B`   |
| `/`    | `%2F`   |
| `:`    | `%3A`   |
| `-`    | `%2D`   |
| `,`    | `%2C`   |

To parse these kinds of encoded values, we use:

```ts
app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: true }));
```

This ensures Express decodes URL-encoded data back into readable key‚Äìvalue pairs.

---

## üß≠ Reading URL and Query Parameters in Express

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ URL Parameters

To tell Express which part of the URL is dynamic, you define a route like:

```ts
pingRouter.get('/:id', pingHandler);
```

Now, if you hit:

```
GET http://localhost:3015/api/v1/ping/30?name=nitish
```

You can log the parameters:

```ts
console.log('url params', req.params);
```

Output:

```
url params [Object: null prototype] { id: '30' }
```

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Query Parameters

If you send a request like:

```
GET http://localhost:3015/api/v1/ping?age=22&city=noida
```

You can log them using:

```ts
console.log('query params', req.query);
```

Output:

```
query params [Object: null prototype] { age: '22', city: 'noida' }
```

---

### üí¨ Why Query Params Work Without Any Extra Setup

Query parameters always come as **strings** (plain text) in the URL itself.
Express can easily parse them from the URL because it knows they‚Äôll always follow the pattern:

```
?key=value&key=value
```

So even without a middleware, Express can automatically extract and parse them for you.

## üèÅ Summary

| Data Type        | Example                | Middleware Needed        | Notes                        |
| ---------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------ | ---------------------------- |
| **Query Params** | `/ping?age=22`         | ‚ùå No                     | Always string type           |
| **URL Params**   | `/ping/:id`            | ‚ùå No                     | Extracted using `req.params` |
| **JSON Body**    | `{ "name": "Nitish" }` | ‚úÖ `express.json()`       | Parses JSON payloads         |
| **URL Encoded**  | `name=Nitish&age=22`   | ‚úÖ `express.urlencoded()` | Parses form data             |

### üß† In Short:

* **Serialization** ‚Üí Converting data (object) into bytes for network transfer.
* **Deserialization** ‚Üí Converting bytes back into usable JavaScript objects.
* Express handles both automatically when you use the correct body-parsing middleware.
* The format of data is identified via the **`Content-Type` header**.
* Query params and URL params are always strings and parsed automatically.

# Problems of rest api
* rest is a architectural pattern and restful is the implementation of that architecture.

* The main problem of restful api is the json because in the json there is no type safety, there is no inherent way to be type safe.

* in json we can send any data types suppose if backend expect name of user like({ "name":"nitish"}) so here if i send 1234 instead of nitish or false it's all ok there is no problem at all for the json but it's concerning because the backend exprect string but we are sending then number or boolean.

* since here there is no type so we can't enfore any contract.

* to solve this problem we have to write an middleware which will parse and validate the incoming request from the client.

## Manual request validation 

* suppose we have to manully valide the coming request then how we will validte, in the following we ay we will validate it, suppose i want the request body must be the string but the coming reqest is number the we should invalidate it.

```ts
 function checkHandler(req:express.Request,res:express.Response,next:express.NextFunction):void {
    if(typeof req.body.name !== 'string'){
       res.status(400).json({
            success:false,
            message:"something went wrong"
        })
    }
    next()
    }
 pingRouter.get('/', checkHandler, pingHandler)
```
* currently i am doing the manual validation but it will become cumersome when there will the nested object coming in the response, that's where comes into the picture of request validation liberary, and these liberary is made in a way that it fit's into the middleware arctitecture and it can check the complex incoming request body.

* one of the famous liberary that is used with typescript is zod liberary it can also implemented with the javascript as well but it's made for typescript first.

# ‚úÖ Integrating Zod for Request Validation in Express + TypeScript

---

## üß© 1. Installation

Install Zod via npm or yarn:

```bash
npm i zod
```

Zod helps you **validate and type-safe your data** in both runtime and compile time.

---

## üß† 2. What is Zod?

Zod works on the concept of **schemas** ‚Äî these schemas define the **expected shape and type** of data (for example, a request body, query parameters, or any other object).

It‚Äôs not limited to Express or request validation ‚Äî Zod can validate **any JavaScript object**.

In simple words:

> Zod lets you describe what you expect your data to look like, and then checks whether the actual data matches those expectations.

If it matches ‚Üí ‚úÖ passes
If not ‚Üí ‚ùå throws a `ZodError` with detailed information about what went wrong.

---

## üìò 3. Example ‚Äì Defining a Schema

```ts
import { z } from "zod";

// Define a schema for a user object
const userSchema = z.object({
  id: z.string().uuid(), // String representing a UUID
  name: z.string().min(2).max(50), // String with min & max length
  email: z.string().email(), // Must be a valid email
  age: z.number().int().positive().optional(), // Optional positive integer
  roles: z.array(z.enum(["admin", "editor", "viewer"])), // Array of allowed strings
  createdAt: z.date(), // Must be a valid Date object
});

// Infer the TypeScript type from the schema
type User = z.infer<typeof userSchema>;
```

Here:

* The schema acts as the **blueprint** for your expected data.
* The inferred type (`User`) automatically syncs with your validation rules.

---

## ‚ö° 4. Quick Demo of Zod Validation

### ‚úÖ When the data **matches** the schema:

```ts
import { z } from "zod";

const obj = {
  name: "nitish",
  age: 22,
};

const objSchema = z.object({
  name: z.string(),
  age: z.number().int().positive(),
});

console.log(objSchema.parse(obj));
```

**Output:**

```bash
{ name: 'nitish', age: 22 }
```

---

### ‚ùå When the data **does not match** the schema:

```ts
const obj = { name: "nitish", age: -22 };
objSchema.parse(obj);
```

**Error:**

```json
[
  {
    "code": "too_small",
    "minimum": 0,
    "inclusive": false,
    "path": ["age"],
    "message": "Number must be greater than 0"
  }
]
```

Zod provides a very descriptive error, making debugging easy.

---

## üß∞ 5. Using Zod for API Request Validation

In a real Express application, each endpoint may have different request shapes ‚Äî e.g.:

* `createUserSchema`
* `updateUserSchema`
* `createPostSchema`
* etc.

We can use **middleware** to validate these automatically before hitting the controller logic.

---

### üß± Step 1: Create a Middleware

```ts
import { AnyZodObject } from "zod";
import { Request, Response, NextFunction } from "express";

// Generic middleware that validates req.body
export const validateRequestBody = (schema: AnyZodObject) => {
  return async (req: Request, res: Response, next: NextFunction) => {
    try {
      await schema.parseAsync(req.body); // asynchronous validation
      next(); // only continue if validation passed
    } catch (error) {
      return res.status(400).json({
        success: false,
        message: "Invalid request schema",
        error: error,
      });
    }
  };
};
```

### ‚úÖ Explanation

| Concept        | Meaning                                                                         |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `AnyZodObject` | Ensures the function only accepts a Zod schema object.                          |
| `parseAsync()` | Validates the data asynchronously and throws an error if invalid.               |
| Middleware     | Runs before the route handler ‚Äî if validation fails, the handler won‚Äôt execute. |

---

### üß± Step 2: Define a Schema for a Route

```ts
// pingSchema.ts
import { z } from "zod";

export const pingSchema = z.object({
  message: z.string().min(1),
});
```

---

### üß± Step 3: Use the Middleware in Your Route

```ts
// ping.routes.ts
import express from "express";
import { pingSchema } from "./pingSchema";
import { validateRequestBody } from "../middlewares/validateRequestBody";
import { pingHandler } from "../controllers/pingController";

const pingRouter = express.Router();

pingRouter.post("/", validateRequestBody(pingSchema), pingHandler);

export default pingRouter;
```

---

### üß© Controller Example

```ts
import { Request, Response } from "express";

export const pingHandler = (req: Request, res: Response) => {
  console.log("Validated request body:", req.body);
  res.status(200).send("Pong!");
};
```

---

## üß† 6. Why Use Middleware for Validation?

‚úÖ **Centralized logic** ‚Äì no need to repeat `schema.parse()` in every controller.
‚úÖ **Scalable** ‚Äì each route can have its own schema.
‚úÖ **Clean separation of concerns** ‚Äì validation handled before business logic.
‚úÖ **Strong TypeScript support** ‚Äì helps prevent type mismatch bugs.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è 7. Optional Improvements

* **Validate query params or URL params**:
  You can extend your middleware to also parse `req.query` or `req.params`.

  Example:

  ```ts
  await schema.parseAsync({ body: req.body, query: req.query, params: req.params });
  ```

* **Global error formatting**:
  Instead of sending raw ZodError, you can use `error.errors` to return a cleaner response.

* **Combine schemas**:

  ```ts
  const fullSchema = z.object({
    body: pingSchema,
    query: z.object({ limit: z.number().optional() }),
  });
  ```

| Concept                            | Description                                             |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Schema**                         | Defines structure and validation rules for data.        |
| **parse / parseAsync**             | Validates data and throws error if invalid.             |
| **validateRequestBody middleware** | Reusable function to validate incoming `req.body`.      |
| **Error handling**                 | Returns meaningful error message when validation fails. |
| **Type inference**                 | Automatically generates TypeScript types from schema.   |

---

### üß© TL;DR

> Zod provides a **type-safe validation layer** that ensures your Express API only processes valid data.
> With a simple reusable middleware and modular schemas, you can keep your controllers clean, predictable, and safe.
